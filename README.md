# Chase the Div front end React.js project

## Technology Used

In this project I use React.js, Bootstrap, SASS, HTML, and CSS.

## Why

I bridge the gap between creativity and technology. Sometimes you just need to get a design out of your head throught he power of code.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
